<h1>Dinosaurs</h1>
<p>Dinosaurs roamed Ancient Earth long ago. Some of them ate plants while others ferociously devoured each other.</p>
<p>Dinosaurs layed eggs. Sometimes other dinousaurs would steal eggs out of nests to eat.</p>
<p>Dinosaurs evolved many times and began to be many different shapes and sizes. Then, many years later, they all died out. Nobody knows why. Scientists think that an asteroid could have wiped them out. Birds are the decendants of the dinosaurs.</p>
<p>Long ago, people began to discover the fossilized bones of the dinosaurs. They had many different theories about what animal the bones had come from. Some people thought they were from giant lizards. Others thought they were from giant people! Until later, nobody guessed the bones were from the fearsome dinosaurs.</p>
<p>Slowly, people began to piece together the mystery of the dinosaurs. They started to figure out what type of animals the dinosaurs were.</p>
<p>Soon, dinosaurs began to appear in movies, books, and pictures.</p>

<h1>Rexy</h1>
<p>Once there was a dinosaur and his name was Rexy. One day, Rexy was walking in the forest. He saw something hiding in the bushes.</p>

<p>He wasn't sure what it was...</p>

<p>Then Rexy remembered. That scary thing hiding in the bushes was Spino, the fierce spinosaurus!</p>

<p>Rexy started to back away from Spino. Then he turned around and ran away as fast as he could.</p>

<p>He heard a rustle and saw Spino burst out of the bushes and start chasing him.</p>

<p>Rexy looked around for somewhere to hide. Spino was still chasing him and he was scared. He ran as fast as he could.</p>

<p>Then Rexy saw a big rock. He could get up on that rock to hide!</p>

<p>Rexy leapt up on the big rock. Then the ground started shaking. Rexy was scared!</p>
<p>Then a lava monster jumped out of the rock with a roar. Rexy had wandered onto the lava monster's rock!</p>
